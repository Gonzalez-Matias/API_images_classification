# Image Classification API

This repository contains an API built with Docker and Flask, which utilizes a ResNet50 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification. The API allows users to send images to the server and receive predictions for the class labels associated with those images.

## Key Features

- Utilizes ResNet50, a pre-trained CNN model for accurate image classification.
- Accepts images in various formats (JPEG, PNG, etc.).
- Provides predictions with class labels for uploaded images.
- Easy deployment with Docker.
- API built using Flask.
